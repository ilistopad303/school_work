# Ian Listopad Final Project

## Data Sourcing
I Chose to do research and ultimately answer questions about population migration within the 
United States. This includes things like where are people moving to, when did the most people collectively move,
what year had the lowest amount of people moving. To answer these questions I employed the help of the US Census Bureau.
That had a dataset that showed all of the population related census information for every census year since 1910.

## Data Preparation
For my Data prep I chose to use Python, simply because it is what I am most comfortable with. I have
used it in my professional life for things other than data analytics so it is what I feel is the easiest to use.  
For this I ended up dropping some of the columns that I did not feel were necessary for my questions, such as the columns 
that dealt with representatives. I Chose not to drop the null lines as they all dealt with region, which is something I will
want to take a look at in my PowerBI models. Fortunately this was mostly a clean dataset, seeing as it was prepared and published by the Census Bureau

## Data Integration
For my Data Integration and visalization I chose to use Power BI to gain my insights. 
This was done because of Power BI's powerful visualization tools allowing me to be able to see and analyze the movement of data or people in this case
it was especially helpful for the geographical visualizations it provided.
